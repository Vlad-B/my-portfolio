		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<hr class="hr-red">
		<div class="paragraphs">
			<p>I always found web development very captivating and fun; however, it wasn't until about 2019 when I finally decided to follow this career path.</p>

			<p>After a few Udemy courses, lots of YouTube tutorials, many code challenges, and trial and error, I finally decided to give it a shot and search for a job in this field.</p>

			<p>I'm very passionate about JavaScript, I find it interesting, and fun to play with, but I'm also a bit of a nerd when it comes to CSS design and animations. It wasn't until very recently when I fell in love creating servers in Node.js - I never thought that I'd enjoy backend this much.</p>

			<p>My ultimate goal is to become a great Full-Stack Developer with a wide range of skills and knowledge in this field.</p>

			<p><strong>The "Ok, but what else..?"</strong></p>

			<p>When I'm not coding, or learning a new JavaScript framework, I like spending my free time playing on my bass guitar, hitting the gym or playing video games.</p>
